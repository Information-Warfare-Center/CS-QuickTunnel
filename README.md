CS-QuickTunnel V.0.6.7 - Reverse Tunnels
https://github.com/infosecwriter/CS-QuickTunnel

The CS-QuickTunnel is a reverse tunneling too that allows you to run a local service on localhost/127.0.0.1 to bypass NAT and firewalls by making outbound connections from a third party server on the Internet. 

You can run the script and host a proxy that forwards traffic to another server, thus making your system a pivot.  Currently works with SSH reverse tunneling, Ngrok reverse tunnel, and Tor.  This script helps set up your .onion address as well.

Reverse tunnel example:
  > localhost: run a PHP server on port 8000

  > ngrok.io: listens on port ????? and forwards the traffic to your PHP server

Reverse Tor tunnel proxy example:
  > system 1: torsocks telnet ku734zo63jwmaaaa.onion 12345

  > localhost: listening on port 12345 and forwarding to towel.blinkenlights.nl on port 23

  > towel.blinkenlights.nl:23

To serve or host Meterpreter or other call back apps, place them into the ./site/installs folder.  Then run either the SSH, Ngrok, or Tor PHP server to generate a link.  Once at that link, type in /installs.php. 

For example: 
- In Tor, go to ???????.onion/installs.php. 
- If on the Internet and using Tor, go to ???????.onion.to/installs.php
- If Ngrok.io, go to ?????.ngrok.io/installs.php
